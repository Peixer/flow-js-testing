description: A Javascript Framework allowing you to test your Cadence code in a simple way 
---

Framework consists of multiple methods allowing you easily:
- start and stop new emulator instance
- deploy contracts
- create new accounts
- send transactions
- execute scripts
- add FLOW to account's balance

It will handle private keys to send transactions and try to automatically resolve import statements (provided, 
that necessary contracts are deployed), so you can focus on writing Cadence code.

## Installation
Follow [these steps](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-js-testing/install) to add framework to your project.
