description: How to structure your Cadence files

Currently, framework expects a specific hierarchy of files inside your base directory.
Assuming your base path is `cadence`, there should be 3 folders inside with names:
- `contracts`
- `transactions`
- `scripts`

You can have nested folders inside them, but templates in each of those root folders would be treated as of certain 
type.
